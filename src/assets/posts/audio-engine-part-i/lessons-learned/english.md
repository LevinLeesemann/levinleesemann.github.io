There were plenty of small lessons along the way, but there are a few larger ones that stick.

One of the more practical takeaways was just how useful Bash scripts (another Derek suggestion) can be once build steps stop being trivial. As soon as cross-platform integration entered the picture, especially around stitching the platform and core layers to the native ones, shell scripts became the glue that held things together. They’re not always pretty, but they’re incredibly effective for automating the fiddly parts of the process.

Another realization was that a certain level of naivety is almost required to take on a project like this. When I started, I had a very limited understanding of what the cross-platform aspect would actually entail. In hindsight, had I fully grasped the scope upfront, I might not have approached it with the same optimism.

This project also reinforced a simple but reassuring idea: no matter how magical a system seems at first, things always have to work somehow under the hood. With enough patience and a willingness to dig, the curtain is eventually pulled back.

Finally, I had to unlearn some hesitation around early prototypes formed in other projects, where tech debt and developer experience weren’t always at the top of the priority list. I’ve been burned before by MVPs that were meant to be revisited but never were, leaving behind fragile codebases. Because of that, I was initially reluctant to move on from rough implementations, particularly with the early web one. Trusting the process, and more importantly committing to cleaning things up as I went, made a huge difference.

All that being said, the project has reached a point where I’m learning constantly, building something stable and extensible, and enjoying the freedom to explore solutions without external constraints.
